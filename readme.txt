Due to regional variation on how to handle decimal places, you must rename the folder named

"items - EN-US format - rename to 'items' to use"

to "items", if you use 1.00, for example, to represent a two digit decimal place.

Likewise, should you use 1,00, then please rename

"items - FR-DE-ETC! format - rename to 'items' to use"

to "items"

- otherwise NSkill will default to using its internal values, and it'll appear you can't edit anything.

And yes, globalization would make so much more sense, but this was made way before that occurred to me :D

Always best to edit these values with NSkill closed down, and reload when you're done.

Have fun.
