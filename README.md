# NSkill - Written by Steven Hill

## Using NSkill

Due to regional variation on how to handle decimal places, you must rename the items folder.

## US and UK Users

if you use 1.00 to represent a two digit decimal place number please rename.

items-en to items, 

## Germany and other European Users

if you use 1,00 to represent a two digit decimal place number please rename.

items-eu to items

Otherwise NSkill will default to using its internal values, and it'll appear you can't edit anything.

And yes, globalization would make so much more sense, but this was made way before that occurred to me D

Always best to edit these values with NSkill closed down, and reload when you're done.

Have fun.
